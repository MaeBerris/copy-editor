1. The existing code has an implementation that can parse text into the correct JSON format, but it is fragile. Try to copy and paste a block of text in and you'll see. The challenge is open-ended in that the goal is to either extend the existing implementation (or refactor/rewrite it completely, if you think that's a better approach!) such that I can copy/paste text in from as many different sources as possible, and have the parsing be able to extract the text and styles of what I've input.

2. I'd love to see a working example, where you take the ability to parse pasted text as far as you can. I understand it might be finicky and you might uncover some pretty wild edge cases. I'm very interested in your thought process, how you approach this problem, what you think the limitations of your implementation is, what are opportunities to go farther if there was more time, etc.

Changes:

In final if statement check if node has name instead of checking if node is span. That way, we check for other types of elements like h1 for example or p

check if style isn't null (like for a br), that saves the app from crashes.

instead of string matching for font-weight, look for font-weight attribute in style and check if value is superior to 400 or if set to bold.
